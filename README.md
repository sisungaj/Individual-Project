# EscapeRealm: UNIV 3279 Individual Project 

Escape rooms are a form of interactive entertainment based around the thrill of logical problem-solving in a semi-stressful environment. However, physical escape rooms have various downfalls, such as high costs for truly immersive rooms, the time commitment, and the gamification that makes the experience less immersive. EscapeRealm is a VR escape room which utilizes VR to reduce some of the limitations of physical rooms. Some of the benefits of having a virtual escape room include more freedom in the logic because the room does not have to be manually reset, there does not have to be locks or doors which can make physical rooms less immersive, and being able to design a single player room which is not economically viable for a physical room. While VR reduces certain limitations, it also creates others. For example, a VR escape room does not require an employee watching the players and resetting the rooms. However, this also creates the problem of not being able to provide individualize hints for when a player is stuck on a puzzle. Another limitation, considering that an hour is the typical time allotment for a physical escape room, is that being in VR for so long can be unpleasant for some players.
